\begin{exercise}{15.42}
Determine all ring homomorphisms from $\mathbb{Q}$ to $\mathbb{Q}$.\\
Suppose $\phi:\mathbb{Q}\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}$ is a homomorphism.  Suppose $\phi(1)=a$.  Note that $a^2=a$ and thus eather $a=1$ or $a=0$.\\
In the case that $a=0$, $\phi(n/m)=\phi(n)*\phi(1/m)=n\phi(1)*\phi(1/m)=n*0*\phi(1/m)=0$.\\
In the case where $a=1$, note that for any integer m, $\phi(m^{-1})*\phi(m)=\phi(1)=1$ and thus $\phi(m^{-1})=\phi(m)^{-1}$.  Note that $\phi(n/m)=\phi(n)[\phi(m)]^{-1}=n\phi(1)[m\phi(1)]^{-1}=n1[m1]^{-1}=n[m]^{-1}=n/m$.\\
We have now found the only two possible homomorphisms, note that both are actually homomorphisms:
$$x\rightarrow 0$$
$$x\rightarrow x$$
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{15.44}
Let $R$ be a commutative ring of prime characteristic $p$. Show that the Frobenius map $\phi : x \rightarrow x^p$ is a ring homomorphism from $R$ to $R$.\\
Note that $\phi(a+b)=(a+b)^p=\sum_{k=0}^p \alpha_k a^kb^{p-k}$ for some integers $\alpha_k$.  Note that the number of copys of $a^kb^{p-k}$ appering here is exactly how many ways we can choose witch term to take the $a$'s from in $(a+b)*\cdots *(a+b)$ witch is ${p}\choose{k}$ (for more info read about Pascal's triangle), thus $\alpha_k={{p}\choose{k}}=\frac{p!}{(p-k)!k!}$.\\
Consider $\alpha_k$ when $k\neq 0$ and $k\neq p$.  In this case note that $p$ will be one of the multiples in $p!$ but not in $(p-k)!k!$ in other words $p$ apears in the prime factorization of the top but not in the prime factorization of the bottom of $\frac{p!}{(p-k)!k!}$ (here we are using the fact that $p$ is prime).  Note that in the reduced form of $\frac{p!}{(p-k)!k!}$, $p$ must still appear in the top thus noting that in the reduced form the botom must be 1 since $\alpha_k$ is a integer we conclude that $p\mid \alpha_k$.  Define $\beta_k$ for $2\leq k\leq p-1$ such that $p\beta_k=\alpha_k$.\\
Now note that $\phi(a+b)=\sum_{k=0}^p \alpha_k a^kb^{p-k}=a^p+b^p+\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \alpha_k a^kb^{p-k}=a^p+b^p+\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \beta_k p (a^kb^{p-k})=a^p+b^p+\sum_{k=1}^{p-1} \beta_k 0_R=a^p+b^p=\phi(a)+\phi(b)$, thus $\phi$ preserves addition.\\
Note that $\phi(ab)=[ab]^p=a^pb^p=\phi(a)\phi(b)$ thus $\phi$ is operation preserving under multiplication.  Note that $\phi$ is a homomorphism.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{15.46}
Show that a homomorphism from a field onto a ring with more than one element must be an isomorphism.\\
Let $F$ be a field and $R\neq \{0_R\}$ be a ring.  Suppose $\phi$ is a homomorphism from $F$ onto $R$.  Note that $\ker(\phi)$ must be a ideal in $F$.  Note that the only ideals in a field are $\{0_F\}$ and $F$.  Choose $a\in R-\{0_R\}$.  Note that there must exist $a'\in F$ such that $\phi(a')=a$ thus $a'\not\in\ker(\phi)$ and thus $\ker(\phi)\neq F$.  Note that $\ker(\phi)=\{0_F\}$, thus $\phi$ is a isomorphism.
