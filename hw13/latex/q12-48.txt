Determine the smallest subring of $\mathbb{Q}$ that contains $2/3$.\\
In general the smallest subring of $R$ that contains $x$ is $H=\{\sum_{i=1}^k a_i x^i\mid k\in \mathbb{Z}^+,(\forall i\in \mathbb{Z}) a_i\in \mathbb{Z}\}$.  This is trivial to show, simply note that any subring that contains $x$ must contain any power of $x$ and any sum of those powers or there negation and so we conclude that any subring containing $x$ must also contain all of $H$.  Then we note that $H$ passes the two step subring test, since any polynomial with integer coefficients subtracted from another polynomial with integer coefficients will be a polynomial with integer coefficients and the multiple of any two polynomials with integer coefficients will be another polynomial with integer coefficients, thus $H$ is a subring of $R$.  Since $H$ is a subring of $R$ and it is contained in all subrings of $R$ containing $x$ we conclude it is the smallest subring of $R$ containing $x$.\\
Thus the smallest subring of $\mathbb{Q}$ that contains $2/3$ is $\{\sum_{i=1}^k a_i 2^i/3^i\mid k\in \mathbb{Z}^+,(\forall i\in \mathbb{Z}) a_i\in \mathbb{Z}\}$.
