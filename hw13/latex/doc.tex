\begin{exercise}{13.15}
Let $a$ belong to a ring $R$ with unity and suppose that $a^n = 0$ for some positive integer $n$. (Such an element is called nilpotent.) Prove that $1 - a$ has a multiplicative inverse in $R$. [Hint: Consider $(1 - a)(1 + a + a^2 +\cdots +a^{n-1} )$.]\\
Note that $b=(1 + a + a^2 +\cdots +a^{n-1} )\in R$ and that $(1-a)b=(1 + a + a^2 +\cdots +a^{n-1} )-(a + a^2 + a^3 +\cdots +a^{n} )=1-a^n=1$ thus $b=(1-a)^{-1}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{13.18}
A ring element $a$ is called an idempotent if $a^2 = a$. Prove that the only idempotents in an integral domain are $0$ and $1$.\\
Suppose $R$ is a intagable domain.  Suppose that $a\not\in \{0,1\}$ and that $a^2=a$.  Note that $a^{-1}$ exists.  Note that $1=aa^{-1}=a^2a^{-1}=aaa^{-1}=a$ a contradiction we now conclude that the only idempotents in an integral domain are $0$ and $1$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{13.22}
Prove that if $a$ is a ring idempotent, then $a^n=a$ for all positive integers $n$.\\
I will procede with proof by induction.\\
Note that the statement is true for $n=1$ and true for $n=2$.\\
Suppose that the statement $a^n=a$ holds for $n\geq 2$.  Note that $a=a^n=aa^{n-1}=a^2a^{n-1}=a^{n+1}$.  By induction we conclude that if $a$ is a ring idempotent, then $a^n=a$ for all positive integers $n$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{13.25}
Find an idempotent in $Z_5 [i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z_5 \}$.\\
Note that $(3+i)^2=8+6i=3+i$, thus $3+i$ is a idempotent in $Z_5 [i] = \{a + bi \mid a, b \in Z_5 \}$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{13.28}
Let $R$ be the set of all real-valued functions defined for all real numbers under function addition and multiplication.
\begin{enumerate}[a)]
\item
Determine all zero-divisors of $R$.\\
The function $f$ is a zero-divisors of $R$ if there exists some $a\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(a)=0$.\\
Suppose $f\in R-\{0\}$ and there exists $a\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $f(a)=0$.  Define $$g(x)=\begin{cases} 1 & x=a\\ 0 & x\neq a \end{cases}$$  Note that $g\neq 0$.  Note that $f*g=0$ thus $f$ is a zero-divisors of $R$.\\
Suppose $f$ is a never zero function.  Suppose $f$ is a zero-divisors of $R$.  There exists $g\in R-\{0\}$ such that $f*g=0$.  There exists $a\in \mathbb{R}$ such that $g(a)\neq 0$.  Note that $f*g(a)=f(a)*g(a)\neq 0$ thus we have a contradiction and we conclude that no never zero functions are zero-divisors of $R$.
\item
Determine all nilpotent elements of $R$.\\
Suppose $f\in R-\{0\}$ and $f$ is a nilpotent element of $R$.  There exists some $n$ such that $f^n=0$.  Note that there exists $a\in\mathbb{R}$ such that $f(a)\neq 0$.  Note that $f^n(a)=(f(a))^n\neq 0$ a contradiction conclude that only $0$ is a nilpotent element of $R$.
\item
Show that every nonzero element is a zero-divisor or a unit.\\
Suppose $f$ is a nonzero element.  Suppose $f$ is not a zero-divisor.  Note that $f$ is a never zero function.  Define a function $g(x)=1/f(x)$.  Note that $f*g=1$.  Conclude $f$ is a unit.  Conclude that every nonzero element is a zero-divisor or a unit.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}{13.31}
Let $R$ be a ring with unity $1$. If the product of any pair of nonzero elements of $R$ is nonzero, prove that $ab = 1$ implies $ba = 1$.\\
Suppose $ab = 1$.
